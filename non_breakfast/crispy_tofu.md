crispy tofu
===========

## ingredients

### tofu

- 1 tofu brick (I usually use an extra firm 16oz brick)

### crisp

- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- (if spicy is desired) 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp cornstarch (heaping)

## directions

unfortunately this is a hurry-up-and-wait sort of recipe

1. slice the brick of tofu into thin (1/2") slabs (usually ~8)
    - As noted in the ingredients, I usually use extra firm tofu, but firm or
      even medium will probably work too. Anything softer than medium may
      disintegrate when drying and/or pan frying.
1. dry for at least an hour
    - I usually place the slabs on paper towels between two cutting boards
      and place heavy bowls on top
    - if you don't want to wait that long, you can press the individual slabs
      with paper towels until they are less wet
1. mix crisp ingredients in separate bowl
1. apply the crisp ingredients to the tofu slabs
    - spoon out a bit of crisp onto a slab and flatten it out
    - flip on the cutting board until the two sides have a coating
1. pan fry on medium heat until lightly browned

## serve

excellent with a soy sauce / vinegar / ginger dipping sauce

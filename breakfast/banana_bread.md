## also try

- try adding a handful or two of chocolate chips

## adjustments

The original recipe had not quite enough sugar.  I also usually make a half
recipe as I rarely have four uneaten bananas.  I also added some spices.

## variations

### pumpkin bread

- Swap out bananas for an equal part of canned pumpkin pie mix.
- For a less-sweet alternative, use canned pumpkin.
- Add a few additional dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg.

## adjustments

The original recipe had an overpowering chocolate flavor -- if I want peanut
butter cookies, I better taste peanut butter!  Therefore I've bumped down the
chocolate chips and up the peanut butter.  You also can't have too much
vanilla.  Experiment with _decreasing_ the sugar (usually the granulated).
